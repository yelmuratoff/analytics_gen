# TODO – `analytics_gen`

## Active Work Items

## Notes
- Tests must also keep covering the export cleanup + analytics plan metadata; broaden them once the new naming strategy and capability adapters land.
- README updates should mention the runtime plan constant, refined watch/export behaviors, and the newly added naming/capability customization knobs.
