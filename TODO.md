# TODO – `analytics_gen`

High-level focus: ship high-signal improvements raised during the last review and keep DX/tests/docs aligned as we go.

## Active Work Items

## Process

- Keep README and example docs fresh as features change.
- Every change must land with focused unit tests (`dart test`).
- Update this TODO after completing each item (check the box + summarize work/tests/docs touched).
