# TODO – `analytics_gen`

## Active Work Items

### Configuration & compatibility
- [x] Document + measure scalability characteristics (parse/generate times, memory) for large plans (100+ domains / 1000+ events) so enterprises understand limits and tuning options.
## Notes
- Tests must also keep covering the export cleanup + analytics plan metadata; broaden them once the new naming strategy and capability adapters land.
- README updates should mention the runtime plan constant, refined watch/export behaviors, and the newly added naming/capability customization knobs.
